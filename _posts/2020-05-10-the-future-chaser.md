### The Future chaser

Afterwards, I have finally learn how to.
But regretfully, you vanished in the crowd.

The future chaser. 
The gardenia with white petals.
Drifted down and feel onto your blue pleated skirt.
Love you, said it softly, lowerd your head and smelt a burst of fragrance.

The future chaser.
If you're the fireworks over the sea then I'm the foam on the waves.
For a moment, the light illuminates you.
If you're a distant galaxy, so dazzling as to make me want to. 
I'm the eyes following you, always gazing at the night sky when lonely.

The future chaser.
Because I have dreams to dream.
I can wait at this crossroad no matter if you pass by or not.
Every time I lift my head for you, event tears feel free. 
Some love is like a sunset, having and losing at the same time.

If you're the summer evening firefly with chilren singing songs for you.
Then I'm the hand that wants to draw you.
Some love is like torrential rain but still believing in rainbows.

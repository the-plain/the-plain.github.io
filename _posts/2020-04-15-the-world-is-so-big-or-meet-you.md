### The world is so big or meet you.

    Backpacks witness the memories of our youth
    We're going to separate and start our lives
    Just get to this intersection
    You don't want to send me, you go back
    Meet and say goodbye

    Everything in the pass will not reappear
    When you not happy 
    Please believe in yourself as I do 
    The world is so big or meet you 
    We've done contless crazy and innocent things together in our memory 
    We have a dream together

    How I wish that one day we would be in our hometown
    The world is so big or meet you 
    We've been together for many years
    No matter how far away
    Never forget our friendship.
